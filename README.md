## About

Music generation is probably one of the most interesting applications of Neural Networks and the modern Artificial Intelligence fields. We created a model that is able to generate piano audio files from Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin. 

### Prerequisites

Before run make sure to install the following package

```
pip install keras-self-attention
```

### Running 

First preprocess the data and train the model

```
python start.py
```

then you can predict, or use the default model

```
python predict.py
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
